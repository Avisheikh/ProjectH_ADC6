The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a
class should have only one reason to change. The Single Responsibility
Principle is closely related to the concepts of coupling and cohesion. 
Coupling refers to how inextricably linked different aspects of
an application are, while cohesion refers to how closely related the 
contents of a particular class or package may be.  All of the contents 
of a single class are tightly coupled together, since the class itself 
is a single unit that must either be entirely used or not at all 
(discounting static methods and data for the moment).  
When other classes make use of a particular class, and that class 
changes, the depending classes must be tested to ensure they continue 
to function correctly with the new behavior of the class.  
If a class has poor cohesion, some part of it may change that only 
certain depending classes utilize, while the rest of it may remain 
unchanged.  Nonetheless, classes that depend on the class must all
be retested as a result of the change, increasing the total 
surface area of the application that is affected by the change. 
If instead the class were broken up into several, highly cohesive 
classes, each would be used by fewer other elements of the system, 
and so a change to any one of them would have a lesser impact on 
the total system.
